# EveEntrepreneurWeb3
A tinkering project, proof of concept and playground for future, more proper application.
EVE Entrepreneur Web is a part of EVE Entrepreneur suite. This application was meant to be a web hub for data access, allowing myself, my friends and guildmates to easily register characters in the system and view the data that would be pulled from the game's API on regular intervals.

This project lacks any front-end polish, but the basic functionality behind it, one that allows users to register characters and view basic data, works.
